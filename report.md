# Project
To view this project work you need to follow these steps:

1. At first you will need a database. It has to run on the same machine as the web server so it can be accessed via `localhost`. The name of the database has to be `shop`. A user with name `shop` and password `FancyShop` has to exist and have sufficient permissions on the database.
2. Import the `shop.sql` file into the database to get all tables and data necessary for the application.
3. The base directory to point the web server to, is the `webapp/` directory.

Now you can start the project by pointing your browser to the `intro.html` file. There you will find a short introduction to the project, what you should look after, what methods may be used and some hints in case they are needed.
